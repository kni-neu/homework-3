{\huge \textbf{Multisource Joins}}  \\

News articles are commonly aggregated from multiple sites and companies. The landscape of news has been evolving ever since social media has amplified its effects. In politics, Congress has explored the topic of bias with the diversity of news sources. That is, news articles may cover news stories with differing perspectives and language. \\

The data that we will be using today comes from Kaggle, and it is available \href{https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs6220/homework-3/}{here}. There are two CSV files that we wish to join in this week's homework:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb"data/id_titles.csv"
    \item \verb"data/id_publishers.csv"
\end{itemize}

As there name suggests, there is publishing data associated with articles and there is title and description information associated with the same articles. Each table has many instances, and each instance for both tables have an associated ID, where it is possible to join the two data sources. \\

In this particular case, there is some missing information in the join. Your task is as follows. \\

{\Large \textbf{Question 1 a.)} [15 pts]}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write out a file that has all the publishers for which there are no titles, called publishers\_no\_titles.txt. This table should look something like the below (ignore the values): \\
    \includegraphics[width=100mm]{images/pub_no_title.png} \\
\end{itemize}

% {\Large \textbf{Question 1 b.)} [15 pts]}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Write out a file that has all the publishers for which there are no titles, called titles\_no\_publishers.txt. That table should look something like the below (ignore the values): \\
    \includegraphics[width=150mm]{images/title_no_pub.png} \\
\end{itemize} 

{\Large \textbf{Question 1 b.)} [5 pts]} \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Explore the data further, and identify any potential problems that could arise if we were to apply any algorithm to it. Is there still missing data? If there are any issues with the data, what might you do to fix it? (You needn't code anything, but conceptually describe any issues you see and how you would remedy it.)
\end{itemize}

{\huge \textbf{Frequent Itemsets}} \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Consider the following set of frequent 3-itemsets:

\begin{verbatim}
{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 4}, 
{2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {3, 4, 5}.
\end{verbatim} \\

Assume that there are only five items in the data set. This question was taken from \href{https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/ch5_association_analysis.pdf}{Tan et al.}, which may help in reviewing Candidate Generation in Rule Generation.\\

{\Large \textbf{Question 2b.)} [10 pts]} \\
List all candidate 4-itemsets obtained by the candidate generation procedure in A Priori, using $F_{k-1} \times F_{k-1}$. \\
\\
% Answer:
% {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 5}, {1, 2, 4, 5}, {2, 3, 4, 5}.

{\huge \textbf{Principle Components Analysis}} \\

Italy is home to over 2000 grape varieties. Even within a single region, wines exhibit distinct attributes from different cultivators that can be measured with objective and numerical features. Notably, in the dataset we are exploring today, there are thirteen different measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of wine. We would like to visualize how well-separated the data is for the different wineries in a 2D scatter plot.\\

We will be using the UCI Wine's dataset. Please review \verb"sklearn"'s description of \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html}{wine data}, and load it in with the following code:
\begin{verbatim}
from sklearn.datasets import load_wine
wine = load_wine()
\end{verbatim} \\

{\Large \textbf{Question 3} [25 pts]} \\

Preprocess the the data with \textbf{z-score normalization} and scatter the data that's been projected onto the first two principle components with different colors for each target/class of wine. \\

{\huge \textbf{Parameter Estimation}} \\

% Any given coin flip can be described by the \textbf{Bernoulli distribution}, which can be written as:

% \begin{equation}
% p(x) = \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{1-x}
% \end{equation}
% From the above, we can see that the probability distribution is parameterized by $\theta$, which is unknown. Here, $x$ is the outcome of the coin flip, where $x=0$ could represent tails and $x=1$ could represent heads. The parameter $\theta$ is the fairness of the coin flip, ranging from [0, 1]. So, for example, if $\theta = 0.5$, it is a fair coin, and $p(x = 0) = p(x = 1) = 0.5$; that is it is equally probable to be either heads or tails. If $\theta = 0.4$, then $p(x = 0) = 0.6$ and $p(x=1) = 0.4$, and it is more likely for the coin toss to be tails.\\
% \\

% {\Large \textbf{Question 3} [15 pts total]} \\

% Let us say that we have a dataset of $N$ coinflips, where we have observed the sequence $\mathcal{D} = x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_N$. In terms of all $x_i$'s, what is the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the value of $\theta$?\\

It is well-known that light bulbs commonly go out according to a Poisson distribution, and are independent regardless of whether or not they're made in the same factory. The Poisson distribution has the form: \\
\begin{equation}
p(X | \lambda) = \frac{ \exp^{-\lambda} \lambda ^{x_i}}{ x_i !} \nonumber
\end{equation} \\

An architect has outfitted a building with 32,000 of the same lightbulb. The factory has provided him with data on when $N$ of these lightbulbs have gone out over their lifetimes. They've been measured with $\mathcal{D} = \{ x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_N \}$\\
\\
{\Large \textbf{Question 4} [25 pts]} \\
\\
Derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter $\lambda$ in terms of $x_i$. Please show your work. \\
